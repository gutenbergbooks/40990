<h2>ROBERT ON THE TEMS.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Me</span> and sum of the Gents of the Lundon County Counsel, as they
calls theirselves, has had sum considerable differences of opinion
lately, but I don&#39;t suppose as it will cum to much. It seems as sum
on em has got theirselves elected into the Tems Conserwancy Gents,
and nothink as is dun quite sattisfys
em unless they has the best
places on bord the crack steamers
as takes em either up the River
or Down the River, as the case
may be. In course they all
wants the werry best heatables
and drinkables, and plenty on
em; but if the water appens to
be jest a little ruff, the one thing
as they all scrambles for is plenty
to heat and plenty to drink, and
a nice quiet seat in the Saloon all the way home.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:20%;">
<img width="100%" src="images/265.png" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="indent">I herd tell the other day as how as some of the Tems Conserwancy
Gents had a reglar quarrel with sum of the County Counsel Gents,
all becoz of the diffrence that sum on em wants to make in the way
in which things is conducted on bord when agoing on their way
home. It most suttenly must make a great diffrence weather it is a
nice, brillyant, sunny day, and all happy on bord, or weather it is a
dull, dark, rainy day, and not room enuff for harf the cumpany.</p>

<p class="indent">I don&#39;t find as how as the too partys in the Corporation agrees with
one another more than they used to when they used to quarrel so
much about everythink. In fack they seems jist as much opposed to
each other as ever, and I, for my part, most truly hopes as how as they
will continue in the same noble spirit, and then they will hate each
other with the same cordial hatred as so distinguished them in days
gone by.</p>

<p class="indent">I don&#39;t know a greater treat myself than spending a nour or too
with the County Counsellers at Charing Cross. They can lay the
stingers about in splendid style, and both sides of the question, much
alike in force, and werry much alike in quolity. But the werry finist
sight of all I shoud think wood be to see a thorowly good set to
between a picked set of the Tems Conserwancy and another of the
County Counsellers. From what I hears of the former I shoud think
their chance would be grand indeed, and from what I have herd of
their reckless perseverance I should think their loss almost incredible.
The Tems is the river for me, and long may it remain so!</p>

<h2>ROUNDABOUT READINGS.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Terrible</span> things have been happening in Newcastle. If any one
doubts this statement, let him read the following extract from one of
the local papers. &quot;Though it is a good while,&quot; observes a leader-writer,
&quot;since it could be said with justice that the trade of the country
was advancing by leaps and bounds, the observation may with absolute
accuracy be made with respect to our Newcastle rates. They
have stolen along with woollen feet, and are now about to strike
with iron hands.&quot;</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p class="indent">I bow to the ground in awe-struck admiration before this picture
of rates stealing along on woollen feet and raising iron hands for a
deadly blow at the unfortunate ratepayers of Newcastle. There is
something fell and savage in the mere contemplation of it. Prose is
quite inadequate to it; it demands rhyme, and must have it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Consider Newcastle, its pitiful case,</p>
<p class="i2">Where the rates have a habit of stealing.</p>
<p>&#39;Tis a way they are prone to in many a place,</p>
<p class="i2">And they do it without any feeling.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>They move without noise, and they thus get the pull,</p>
<p class="i2">Like a cab with a new rubber tyre on;</p>
<p>For their feet, it is said, are a compound of wool,</p>
<p class="i2">Though the hands that they strike with are iron.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>The vision appals me, one glimpse is enough;</p>
<p class="i2">With terror my bosom is heaving.</p>
<p>Yet I venture the hint&mdash;do not treat it as stuff&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">That steel were more suited for thieving.</p>
</div>
</div>

<hr class="short"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Something</span> always appears to be wrong with the streets of Bristol.
I had to notice the melancholy case of Christmas Street last week.
The epidemic has now extended to Old Market Street. Here the
pitching is so dangerous that horses fall and break their legs, and
ladies die from falls on Easter Mondays. A correspondent who calls
attention to this matter says that &quot;it is quite annoying on a busy
day to have to ask customers two, three, or even four times what
they require.&quot; I scarcely see what this has to do with the pavement,
but personally I have always found it more than annoying to be
asked four times as much as I require, even when my requirements
are small, as they usually are. It is gratifying to find that, in Old
Market Street, at any rate, the shopkeeper who asks has an equal
share of annoyance.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Then</span> again, Conduit Place, Lower Ashley Road, is not only badly
lighted, but its name is practically unknown. &quot;Even shopkeepers in
the neighbourhood and policemen on the beat do not seem to know of
it, and sometimes lead people astray in consequence.&quot; This, however,
is not to be wondered at, as &quot;another difficulty is the numbering
of the houses; although only about thirty in the road, they are
divided into five terraces with different sets of numbers, which causes
endless confusion.&quot;</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><span class="smcap">Increase</span> not, wanderer, the policeman&#39;s load;</p>
<p>Ask not the site of Lower Ashley Road.</p>
<p>Inquire not eagerly for Conduit Place,</p>
<p>But start unasking on thy terraced chase.</p>
<p>These places to policemen are unknown,</p>
<p>So shall the pride of finding be thine own.</p>
<p>Go forth, go forth, itinerary pundit,</p>
<p>And find the place that takes its name from Conduit.</p>
<p>Thy journey, after many a turn and twist&#39;ll</p>
<p>Land thee at Lower Ashley Road in Bristol.</p>
<p>Then pause, and, having raised a thankful voice,</p>
<p>Take &#39;midst five terraces thy doubtful choice;</p>
<p>And, envied by policemen on their beats,</p>
<p>Return, a lexicon of Bristol streets.</p>
</div>
</div>

<hr class="short"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">But</span> the badness of the streets and the ignorance of policemen
as to their whereabout is nothing to the annoyance caused by the
Salvation Army bands near St. Clement&#39;s Church in Newfoundland
Road. &quot;On Ascension Day,&quot; the Vicar writes, &quot;our service
was completely stopped for several minutes, as the preacher,
who had a bad cold, was unable to shout above the din of the passing
drum.&quot; I shudder to imagine what would have been the plight of the
congregation if the preacher had been free from cold, and capable of
shouting down a drum.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Rowing</span> and cricket are more closely connected than many people
suppose. In an account of the Oxford eight-oared bumping races,
I read that &quot;New College started at a tremendous bat.&quot; This of
course accounts for the bawling on the bank by which these races
are always accompanied. Further on it is stated that &quot;New College
finished at 40, all out&quot;&mdash;which seems rather a small score.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">I commend</span> the brevity of the Mayor of Cambridge, Mr. <span class="smcap">Hyde
Hills</span>, who, being obviously above Hyde Park, does not condescend
to the verbosity of the spouters who on Sundays congregate in that
locality. The other day Mr. <span class="smcap">Hyde Hills</span> was elected to be an
Alderman, and all he said was, &quot;I thank you.&quot; This is <i>optimi
exempli</i>, especially for Aldermen.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Lately</span> I came across the following touching appeal of an impecunious
son to his father:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Sir,&mdash;I have piles of bills,</p>
<p>Regular miles of bills;</p>
<p class="i2">My banking account&#39;s in a hash.</p>
<p>All on the debtor side,</p>
<p>Nought on the better side;</p>
<p class="i2">The balance you&#39;d hardly call &quot;cash.&quot;</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>&#39;Tis terrible when you&#39;re reduced thus to penury,</p>
<p class="i2">Even if <i>that&#39;s</i> nothing new.</p>
<p>Hope! Can I dream of it?</p>
<p>Yes, there&#39;s a gleam of it;</p>
<p class="i2">My quarter&#39;s allowance is due!</p>
</div>
</div>

<hr class="short"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">At</span> the Bigg Market in Newcastle was recently held what a local
paper describes as &quot;a demnostration in favour of temperance
reform.&quot; &quot;Demnostration&quot; is a delightful word. It seems to express
in the most compact form enthusiasm and strong language.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A Question of Police.</span>&mdash;A few days since Liverpool set another
lesson to London. No doubt with the consent of the Liverpudlians
(inclusive of &quot;the dangerous classes&quot;), the local police force had a
grand field-day. To quote our excellent contemporary, the
<i>Courier</i>, &quot;those who witnessed the police&#39;s steady march through
the streets in three battalions, and their effectively-performed
man&oelig;uvres in Sefton Park, would hardly realise what the turn-out
meant to most of the men. They were on duty through the night,
and had very little rest before they had to parade for inspection
(with the march-out and review), and the weather being warm, the
display involved fatigue, so that the refreshments provided were
very welcome.&quot; Yes, and no doubt well deserved. But why should
London wait? Why should not we have something of the same
kind? We might have a grand Police Review in Hyde Park. All
that would be necessary would be to arrange that the metropolitan
thieves should keep the ground!</p>

<h2>NOTES FROM A PATIENT&#39;S DIARY.</h2>

<blockquote class="note">
<p class="indent">
[&quot;Music is a serious therapeutic agent, which exercises a genuine and
considerable influence over bodily functions.&quot;&mdash;<i>The Lancet.</i>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Feel rather out of sorts, slight touch of influenza, I
fancy. Send round for Doctor. He shakes his head gravely, and
produces stethoscope. I protest that there&#39;s nothing wrong with my
lungs, and this is, therefore, unnecessary. But he explains that he
treats all his patients by music nowadays; supposed stethoscope
turns out to be a cornet, on which he performs selections from
<i>Il Trovatore</i> for my benefit. Asks me if I feel better, and in order
to get rid of him I pretend that I do. Later on in the day a small
musical-box arrives, labelled &quot;to be taken twice a day.&quot; Find it
only plays one tune out of <i>Rigoletto</i>. Pitch it out of window.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;No better. Consult another doctor, who&#39;s just taken his
degree (in music) at Oxford, and is supposed to be very clever. He feels
my pulse, and looks solemn. Then he asks if I&#39;ve been giving way
to Italian opera lately, and appears coldly sceptical when I explain
that I have been taking it by medical advice. Prescribes essence of
<span class="smcap">Wagner</span>, to be taken at short intervals. Begin by attending a
<span class="smcap">Richter</span> concert. Dr. <span class="smcap">Richter&#39;s</span> practice is said to be enormous,
and every part of St. James&#39;s Hall is thronged by his patients.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Better. Receive a large number of patent medicine
circulars&mdash;this kind of thing: &quot;Try our Indigestion Waltzes! Warranted
to cure. All headache, giddiness and faintness removed at
first time of hearing.&quot; Here&#39;s another: &quot;Dentists superseded! All
sufferers from Toothache should attend Herr <span class="smcap">Boskowsky&#39;s</span> course of
Dental Piano Recitals. Worth a guinea a stall.&quot; I also learn that
the Hirsutine Symphony cures baldness, and that the Pink Bavarian
Band may be engaged to play &quot;Slumber-Songs&quot; to sufferers from
insomnia.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Am aroused by five barrel-organs performing simultaneously
under my next-door neighbour&#39;s window. Send a note
round suggesting they should be dispersed. Answer &quot;Sorry to
cause annoyance, but our youngest child is suffering from chickenpox,
and has been ordered street-music every three hours.&quot; Go out
to buy an air-gun. Later in the day, happening to take up the
<i>Lancet</i> at the Club, I find in it a long article on &quot;The treatment of
pleurisy by <span class="smcap">Beethoven&#39;s</span> Fifth Symphony in C Minor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Two seedy-looking men suddenly appear in the
drawing-room after dinner to-night. Discover that they are &quot;The
Brothers <span class="smcap">Tittlebat</span>&quot; from the Abracadabra Music Hall, and that my
wife has engaged them, by her doctor&#39;s orders, to sing comic songs
every evening for a fortnight, in order to cure the depression of
spirits from which she believes herself to be suffering. &quot;The Brothers
<span class="smcap">Tittlebat</span>&quot; seem to be suffering themselves from elevation of spirits&mdash;gin,
to judge by the smell; kick them out, and decide to emigrate
to-morrow.</p>

<hr />

<h2>LA DIVA AT DALY&#39;S.</h2>

<p class="indent"><i><span class="smcap">Gismonda</span></i> is poor stuff. The selection was a mistake. Lucky man
<span class="smcap">Sardou</span> to have <span class="smcap">Sara</span> for heroine. Great is <span class="smcap">Sardou</span> and <span class="smcap">Sara</span> is his
profit! Splendid as ever, but genius wasted on <i>Gismonda</i>. She will
be seen at her best in other dramas. Wonderful <i>artiste!</i></p>

<p class="indent">Yes, <i>artiste jusqu&#39;au bout des ongles</i>, but why give us these
real good tips, painted red? If it were in English, <span class="smcap">Sara</span> might make
some joke about her fingers being &quot;reddy&quot; for the assassination of
the villain. This explanation does not exist in French. Probably
it was the fashion in the time of <i>Gismonda</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Will any dramatist give <span class="smcap">Sara</span> an entirely new part in which she
will not be compelled to purr, swear (like a cat, not a trooper), scratch,
shriek, tumble on settees, clutch curtains, wrestle with cushions,
and so forth?</p>

<p class="indent">Why, on first night, revive old custom of handing up baskets of
flowers, per orchestra, to the heroine of the play and the Star of the
Night? Why keep the audience waiting so long between each Act?
We are not in Paris, and when we have too much &quot;song,&quot; or play,
we can&#39;t get any &quot;supper.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Note</span> (<i>by our City Man</i>).&mdash;Excellent notion for a hot June&mdash;&quot;the
<i>Chili</i> Loan.&quot; It will be a hot favourite: to be taken up warmly.
<i>Mem.</i> Invest &quot;cool thousand&quot; in the Chili Loan.</p>

<h2>THE SCARLET PARASOL.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Scene III.</span>&mdash;<i>The Hall. A quarter to Three in the afternoon.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Muriel</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Alan</span>, <i>who is just taking his hat</i>). Oh! <i>May</i> I speak
to you one moment, Master <span class="smcap">Roy</span>?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alan.</i> Pray do, dear Miss <span class="smcap">Vane</span>. I am just going for a stroll by
myself&mdash;to&mdash;to develope an idea I&#39;ve got.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Muriel.</i> If you should happen to be going for a secret drive along
the high road with <span class="smcap">Viola</span>, in a dog-cart from <span class="smcap">Johnstone&#39;s</span>, <i>would</i>
you be so kind as to give her this? (<i>Hands scarlet parasol.</i>) She
forgot it. And don&#39;t let her leave it anywhere. You see her initials
are carved round it. And she is <i>always</i> losing things. Please be
very careful!</p>

<p class="author">[<i>She smiles.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alan.</i> What on earth can have given you such an extraordinary
idea, Miss <span class="smcap">Vane</span>?</p>

<p class="author">[<i>Takes parasol.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Muriel.</i> Well, a sort of coach-building, livery-stable person, from
<span class="smcap">Johnstone&#39;s</span>, is engaged to <span class="smcap">Jane</span>, the housemaid. He came to see
her to-day.... She has been ill, poor thing!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alan.</i> How very distressing!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Muriel.</i> <span class="smcap">Viola</span> <i>said</i> she was going to visit cottages. However, in
<i>case</i> you <i>should</i> meet&mdash;one never knows&mdash;you&#39;ll
give her the sunshade.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alan.</i> You may depend upon it, Miss <span class="smcap">Vane</span>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alan.</i> That&#39;s a perfectly delicious hat of yours!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Viola.</i> I am so glad you like it! This is a very
nice dog-cart, and this is a pretty lane to drive in,
so cool and green.</p>

<p class="author">[<i>A pony-carriage passes.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Viola</i> (<i>starting violently</i>). Good heavens! There
are the clergyman and his wife.</p>

<p class="author">[<i>She bows, blushing crimson.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alan.</i> Why are you agitated, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Travers</span>?
They look very gentle and harmless.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Viola.</i> Gentle and harmless! If they tell <span class="smcap">Albert</span>?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alan.</i> Does he disapprove of the clergy taking
exercise in the open air?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Viola</i> (<i>pettishly</i>). Of course not. How absurd!</p>

<p class="author">[<i>A silence.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alan.</i> Shall we get out presently, and sit in one
of these nice fields, and make daisy-chains? There
are daisies in fields, I know&mdash;though I <i>am</i> rather
urban.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Viola.</i> Oh, yes; and cowslips!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alan.</i> You ought to give a cowslip-ball, Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Travers</span>. It would be charming. May I come?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Viola.</i> If you&#39;re old enough by then!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alan.</i> Oh, I&#39;m never going to be old enough.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Viola.</i> Really not?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alan</i> (<i>candidly</i>). It&#39;s a great thing to have
settled on one&#39;s pose, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Travers</span>; and one

you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Viola.</i> About yourself?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alan.</i> No, about you. Things you don&#39;t know&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Viola</i> (<i>starting</i>). Oh! Is that someone we know?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alan.</i> I <i>hope</i> you wouldn&#39;t know a man who wears such a hat as
that in the country!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Viola.</i> It&#39;s all right&mdash;I <i>don&#39;t</i> know him.</p>

<p class="author">
[<i>Sits down.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alan</i> (<i>trying to recover the thread</i>). About yourself&mdash;your eyes, for

<h2>SPORT, SPECULATION, AND COUNSEL&#39;S OPINION.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">So</span> many letters have reached me during the past week begging
for my opinion upon the legality of what may be termed sporting
financial speculation, that I scarcely apologise for asking the hospitality
of the columns of the leading law paper to give my response.
No doubt the inquiry has to some extent been fostered by the report
that I was seen taking part in the hippodromatic revels of the
Derby Day. It is true that I certainly visited Epsom on the occasion
in question; but only in a semi-official capacity. I have the
honour to be consulting assessor of the Diamond Mine Salting Syndicate,
Limited, and in that desirable position have frequently attended
the meetings of the directors on occasions, so to speak, outside the
Board-room. It is true that my experience as one learned in the law
is seldom required at such seasons, still the directors, as fiduciaries,
are to be applauded for neglecting no opportunity of availing themselves
of my services.</p>

<p class="indent">Having satisfactorily explained how it came that I was on the
Downs when, by a not unnatural coincidence, the Derby was decided,
I proceed to consider the question that has been propounded
to me. Is sporting speculative finance illegal? It is not a matter
that can be decided off-hand. One must be careful not to interfere
with the policy of trade, and do nothing to impede the development
of honest industry. I am asked by a correspondent, who dates &quot;From
Sheffield,&quot; if there is anything undignified in his appearing as a
&quot;bookie&quot; in a pink velvet coat, a yellow slouch hat, with blue
feathers, and black leather knickerbockers. I can see no objection to
a tradesman wearing any costume he determines to select. It would
perhaps be as well not to attempt to disguise his features, as the
operation might savour of secrecy, the chief element of fraud. This
limitation of course does not apply to an auctioneer, who, having his
name and address displayed on a board hanging on the rostrum he
occupies, can legally carry on his business, if it so pleases him, in a
false nose, a comic wig, and a pair of green spectacles.</p>

<p class="indent">But really, a consideration of the costume of the &quot;bookie&quot; merely
reaches the fringe of the subject. The real point at issue is this&mdash;Is
betting legal or illegal? It is hard to say. That a bet made on the
racecourse is recoverable is questionable. Suppose that A is prepared
to give odds against <i>The Earl&#39;s Choice</i> (the favourite, quoted
officially at 2 to 1) at the rate of five shillings against one
thousand pounds sterling. Presume that B agrees to the wager and
<i>The Earl&#39;s Choice</i> wins. B naturally asks for the immediate payment
by A of one thousand pounds sterling. A declines. Has B any
remedy against A? I am afraid that the Court (although allowing
costs on the higher scale) would not assist the plaintiff in making
good his claim. However, it would be possible for B to represent to
the other side that the conduct of A was of a character warranting
chronic detention in a lunatic asylum. If this suggestion were
adopted with the necessary discretion, I have no doubt that a compromise
satisfactory to B would eventually be the outcome of the
negotiations.</p>

<p class="indent">However, although I am a little uncertain about other bets, I have
no doubt in my own mind that coach sweepstakes under certain circumstances
should be discouraged. I do not wish to rely upon case
law, but would rather appeal to that honest, manly feeling that is (so
I have been given to understand) the birthright of every Englishman.
When all Nature is smiling, and man (smoking a three-shilling cigar)
is at rest, why trouble about mounts and starters and blanks?</p>

<p class="indent">I have in my mind at this moment the drawing of a certain sweepstakes.
An eminent counsel (I will not mention his name), was present
and drew a blank. On his behalf I appeal for a revision, a reversal
of judgment. Do not let there be a mixture of the glories of
Nature with the ups and down of sporting speculative practice. Let
those who took part in that sweep&mdash;winners and losers alike&mdash;return
their stakes. I will hold them on the general behalf. Then when I
have received the cash as trustee I will find out that eminent counsel
and place the money in his hands. I have nothing more to add,
save to set forth as a guarantee of good faith my signature warranted
by my address.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> particular Baronitess to whom the Baron handed over <i>The
Holy Estate</i> (a novel in three volumes, by two authors, <span class="smcap">W. H. Wilkins</span>
and <span class="smcap">Frank Thatcher</span>, published by <span class="smcap">Hutchinson &amp; Co.</span>), says
that in explanation it is called by its authors &quot;a study in morals,&quot;
but where the morals come in or come out
it would be difficult to say. Apparently,
in the majority of the characters, there is a
singular lack of any virtuous quality. A
young innocent girl marries a gay soldier
and goes out to India. Here she finds herself
placed in a land where principles are decidedly
at a discount. Her husband turns
out, to put it mildly, a blackguard (with a
big, big &quot;B&quot;), and his friends are of the
same fascinating type. In a typical, melodramatic,
&quot;Adelphi villain,&quot; there is something
almost wholesome as compared with
the modern bad man of &quot;<i>Yellow-Book</i>&quot;
fiction, who is simply revolting. [By the
way, interpolates the Baron, the latest
<i>Yellow Book</i> is comparatively quite decorous
and without an Aubrey-Beardsley
illustration!!] Of course, the hero and
heroine of <i>The Holy Estate</i> have to pass
through the fiery ordeal of Indian Society;
how they come out of it the reader may
discover. But as pessimism is the artistic
order of the day, they are not allowed to finish well and &quot;live happy
ever afterwards.&quot; My Baronitess adds, with a frown, &quot;It cannot be
called pleasant reading, nor is there in it any sign of the genius of
a <span class="smcap">Daudet</span> or a <span class="smcap">Zola</span> which might be accepted as, in some sort, a

<h2>A MODEL REMODELLED.</h2>

<p class="indent">The &quot;Revised Edition&quot;&mdash;probably to style
it &quot;The Revised Version&quot; would savour too
much of the Biblical Committee Room&mdash;of <i>An
Artist&#39;s Model</i> now removed to the Lyric is
occasionally &quot;funny,&quot; though not absolutely
&quot;without being&quot; occasionally &quot;vulgar.&quot; Its
weakest point is its story, but as the plot
only occasionally obtrudes itself upon the
audience, the weakest point is, therefore, not
worth mentioning, only its strong points,
which consist in <span class="smcap">Marie Tempest&#39;s</span> singing,
but not in what she has to sing, and in Miss
<span class="smcap">Letty Lind&#39;s</span>  mild warbling and charming
dancing, which latter thoroughly deserves the
hearty encores she obtains, as does also Mr.
<span class="smcap">Farkoa&#39;s</span> capital rendering of an otherwise
not particularly brilliant French laughing
song. Mr. <span class="smcap">Eric Lewis</span> and Mr. <span class="smcap">W. Blakeley</span>
attain great distinction by their clever rendering
of nothing in particular.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hayden Coffin</span> appears depressed.
But comic relief to his sentimental sadness is
given by both <span class="smcap">Lawrance D&#39;Orsay</span>, with as
much of the traditional <span class="smcap">D&#39;Orsay</span> courtliness
that is left of it, and Mr. <span class="smcap">Farren Soutar</span>,
worthy inheritor of a double talent. Lyrics
of <span class="smcap">H. Greenbank</span> neat, as they always are;
but the compositions of Mr. <span class="smcap">Sidney Jones</span>
will probably &quot;keep the stage,&quot; as it is impossible,
at one hearing, at all events, to carry
any of it away with you. The &quot;house,&quot; on
this occasion, excellent; far better than the
piece.</p>

<h2>&quot;WATERS, WATERS EVERYWHERE!&quot;</h2>

<p class="indent">One of the reasons for the popularity of
Apollinaris Water mentioned the other day
at a &quot;meeting of the waters&quot; was, that men
generally soon became on such intimate terms
with this water-nymph as to be able to speak
of her familiarly as &quot;Polly.&quot; &quot;Whisky and
Polly&quot; seemed to go so well together as to be
suggestive of a round dance, in which the
admirer of &quot;Polly&quot; was whisky-ing her
round the ball-room. The gradual rise of
Johannis in public opinion, delayed, of course,
in the first place, by politeness on the part
of &quot;Johnnie,&quot; who must cede the <i>pas</i> to
&quot;Polly,&quot; is due to the fact that the aërated-water
drinkers had not made up their minds
as to whether Johannis was to be addressed
as &quot;Jo&quot; or &quot;Johnnie.&quot; We believe that
&quot;Johnnie&quot; is now the accepted appellation.
Whether &quot;Johnnie&quot; and &quot;Polly&quot; are on the
best terms, this deponent knoweth not; nor
is he aware that during the season The
Bishop of Bath and Wells or The Bishop of
Sodor-water-and-Man will bless the union of
&quot;Johnnie&quot; and &quot;Polly,&quot; though at one time
there was a report to that effect. To alter the
title of the old semi-nautical drama, <i>Poll and
Partner Joe</i>, of which the second hero was a
Water-man, &quot;Poll and her Partner Johnnie&quot;
ought to get on well together.</p>

appeared on that memorable occasion in &quot;a

and trousers, with grey fez turban to
match. No doubt the head-dress was relieved
with a diamond worth £1,000,000, or something
of the sort, just to show that our guest
was of eastern origin. The following suggestion
for complete outfits may be found
useful:&mdash;</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Extracted from the Diary of Toby, M.P.</span></p>

<p class="center">Ritchie Redivivus!</p>

<p class="center">(From a sketch picked up near the Front Opposition Bench.)</p>
</div>

<p class="indent"><i>House of Commons, Monday, May, 27.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ritchie</span>
back to-day, after long absence.
Changed address from Tower Hamlets to
Croydon. Waiting to be called to table by
<span class="smcap">Speaker</span>, had opportunity of hearing long
debate round Bill promoted by London County
Council. <span class="smcap">Ritchie</span>, as President of Local Government
Board in last Ministry, made London
County Council possible. Happy thought to
play him in, as it were, with County Council
debate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Been out of it nearly three years now,
<span class="smcap">Toby</span>,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Ritchie</span>, when, one of a score of
old members, I went to shake hands and bid
him welcome; &quot;just the same old place;
perhaps a little duller at the moment. What
they want is new blood, or, perhaps, better
still, a re-infusion of old blood. Can&#39;t give
them a new County Council Bill; must try
and make them somehow sit up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">These thoughts pressed upon him as he stood
at table signing Roll of Parliament after
having been sworn in. Brought his hat with
him, as new Members do, since, as yet, they
have no peg to hang it on. Placed it on table
whilst he signed the Roll. Passing on to be
introduced to <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>, observed with a start
that there were two hats on the table. Odd.
Was sure he had brought only one. Blessed
is the man who makes two blades of grass
grow where formerly only one peeped forth.
Possibly analagous benison for a man who,
planting one hat down on a table, looks and
behold there are two. Happy omen; make
the most of it; wouldn&#39;t do to go
off with two hats. House sure to remark it.
Besides, how could he shake hands with the
<span class="smcap">Speaker</span> holding a hat in either hand? Next
best thing to select the newest; did so with
pretty air of abstraction; advanced one step
between table and Treasury Bench on way to
<span class="smcap">Speaker&#39;s</span> chair when he felt firm grip on his
elbow, and a well known voice in his ear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give me neither <span class="smcap">Ritchies</span> nor poverty, but
do leave me my hat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was the voice of the <span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I beg your pardon. How d&#39;ye do?&quot;
said <span class="smcap">Ritchie</span>, hurriedly returning the <span class="smcap">Squire&#39;s</span>
Sunday hat, and taking up his own, which
had suffered the rigours of a wet and windy
nomination day.</p>

<p class="indent">House cheered and laughed. <span class="smcap">Knatchbull-Hugessen</span>
gravely shook his head. &quot;That&#39;s
all very well,&quot; said he. &quot;But a man who
would pander to the lowest instincts of humanity
by clearing the way for parish councils,
would do anything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Another night&#39;s talk round

<p class="indent"><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Prospect of hearing <span class="smcap">John William</span>

sufficed to crowd benches. Such encounter of
wits rarely delights mankind these degenerate
days. Such lightness of touch! Such gleaming
attack! Such brilliant defence! In short,
such badinage! Such persiflage! Old Members
recall earlier conflicts in same field.
Young Members look back on clever speech
made by <span class="smcap">Elcho</span> in moving adjournment one

in the following Session, he seconded <span class="smcap">Wilfrid

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>

<p class="author"><i>Mr. Chamberlain&#39;s Speech at Birmingham,
May 29.</i></p>
</div>

<p class="indent">This was natural expectation from reputation of these famous wits.
In dreary conversation that followed there was one solitary flicker
of humour; it was discovered
by anxious
searcher in the circumstance
that the
whole business was
utterly, hopelessly
prosaic. There wasn&#39;t
a laugh in it from
beginning to end.
House begins to think
it has had enough of
this elaborate annual
tourney of humour.
Next year, if motion
for adjournment over
Derby Day is made, it
will be better to have
question put forthwith,
and so divide.
Another experience
like the exceedingly
bad half-hour endured
this afternoon is more
than should fall to the
lot of a single generation.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;House
agreed by
221 votes against 174
that it could not
afford to take a holiday.
Straightway
proceeded to waste
remainder of sitting in vain repetition of argument round clauses of
Welsh Disestablishment Bill.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Well for <span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span> he chanced to be absent
to-night when Cap&#39;en <span class="smcap">Tommy Bowles</span> hauled alongside <span class="smcap">Silomio</span> and
raked him fore and aft. <span class="smcap">Kenyon</span>, who knows
more than you think when you hear him speak,
tells me it is pretty certain when the next
Government is formed <span class="smcap">Silomio</span> will have his
choice of succeeding either <span class="smcap">Edward Grey</span> or
<span class="smcap">Sydney Buxton</span>. Neither office is of Cabinet
rank. But with the chief in the Lords, a statesman
of <span class="smcap">Silomio&#39;s</span> ability and sagacity can make
and keep a position equal in importance and
influence to some more highly placed. No one
will deny that the promotion will have been
well earned. The Sheffield Knight has, perhaps,
been more prominently associated with the conduct
of Colonial affairs than with those nominally
directed by Lord <span class="smcap">Kimberley</span> with the assistance
of <span class="smcap">Edward Grey</span>. This is a view strengthened
by the circumstance of the honourable title conferred
upon him by the emissaries from Swaziland.
Actually, <span class="smcap">Silomio</span> knows quite as much of Foreign
Affairs as he does of Colonial.</p>

<p class="indent">To-night, on Vote on Account, he concentrated
his attention on the action of the Foreign Office.
Surveying its operations from China to Peru, he
was constrained unreservedly to condemn them.
Everywhere the British Minister had truckled to
the foreigner. The flag of England, which the
emigrants in the <i>Mayflower</i> proudly carried
with them even in their exile, was dragged
through every gutter of foreign capitals.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There never was a time,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Silomio</span>,
&quot;when this country was so isolated among the
nations of Europe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This grand speech echoed through nearly
empty House. <span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span> and his colleagues
on Front Opposition Bench, as usual,
paid their distinguished colleague the highest
compliment. They knew he would say the right thing in the right
way, at the right time. Whilst he kept the gate no traitor could
pass, no harm befall a beloved country. So, with one accord, they
went off, leaving <span class="smcap">Casabianca Silomio</span> to tread alone the deck,
burning with his eloquence.</p>

<p class="indent">On the benches behind sat only <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>, who sometimes wishes
<span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span> had a little more of <span class="smcap">Silomio&#39;s</span> go; <span class="smcap">Knatchbull-Hugessen</span>
who doesn&#39;t think the Knight is quite the model of a
country gentleman, but likes to hear him shout at the Government;
and Cap&#39;en <span class="smcap">Tommy Bowles</span>, wearing his best Sunday ducks in
honour of a sultry day that reminds him faintly of breathless moments
spent in the Forties in the Bight of Benin.</p>

speech; lamented the
effect upon foreign
powers of its delivery
&quot;by a responsible
leader of the party&quot;;
and said much else
that would have
shocked the House
had Members chanced
to be present. <span class="smcap">Prince
Arthur</span>, who so
acutely felt, and so
bitterly resented,
<span class="smcap">George Russell&#39;s</span>
recent sneer at the
Patriot Knight, was
spared the anguish of
the moment by that carefully concerted movement which, happily,
calls <span class="smcap">Silomio&#39;s</span> colleagues off the Front Bench when he is about to
discourse on Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;House met to wind up business
previous to Whitsun recess. <span class="smcap">Alpheus Cleophas</span>,
always considerate, been thinking over
ways of enjoying the holiday. Struck him
nothing would be nicer than free admission for
M.P.&#39;s and their friends to witness process of
vivisection. Put the matter before <span class="smcap">Home
Secretary</span> in his genial way. <span class="smcap">Asquith</span> very
sorry, but has no power to give the desired
admission. <span class="smcap">Alpheus Cleophas</span> a little depressed,
but went off with the consciousness
that he had at least done his best.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no enterprise in these people,
<span class="smcap">Toby</span>,&quot; he complained. &quot;We in London are
much behind the age. We haven&#39;t here what in
Paris is, I believe, called the Mor-gew: a nice,
quiet place to turn into when you are out
holiday-making. I have my own resources.
When house is shut and I can&#39;t go about the
basement and cellars smelling out the oil lamps,
I sit on edge of fountain in Trafalgar Square
and sniff its balmy waters. Everyone not
equally independent. If we had only about the
parks and in the thoroughfares places open to
the respectable public where they might see
vivisection going on, we should be a happier
nation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;House adjourned for the
